      <h3>Meraz Hossain</h3>
      <p> I am relatively new at programming, having learnt some Python for GCSE but not having coded for nearly 2 years.
         So learning another new language (Java) has proven quite difficult at first, but slowly I have been starting to get the hang of it again.
         Starting to code again has been enjoyable and facing new challenges has been eye opening and forced me to think more creatively and improved 
         my problem solving skills.

    <h3>Year 1 Java Project : 2D Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first project in year 1 in City University of London was creating a functional 2D game in Java. This project has taught me various 
  things, especially many object oriented programming principles such as polymorphism and encapsulation. The main objective of this game is
  to collect enough coins so you can advance to the next level, while having the ability to shoot and kill enemies along the way. Once enough
  coins have been collected, the character can move to the next level. The boss fight levels have randomly generated fireballs spawning on top of
  the character, requiring the player to dodge while collecting coins. At the end of the game, you can see how many coins and kills you have amassed.
